<h4>Statement of Work: </h4>
Our project is a web application for announcing and inviting people to events to be used by groups at UTD (ex. clubs, fraternities, etc.). The project, known as KickMap, is a service that will allow organizations to post kickbacks, kickoffs, socials, and parties on an interaactive map of campus and surrounding areas. Users can see event announcements, compare them, see tickets availability, check hosts, and view where they are on a map and when on a calendar. Right now, many of these events are announced in an unorganized conglomerate of Instagram posts and Discord announcements. This application is one way to allow students to know what events are where and when in a common service.
