Statement of Work: 
Our project is a web application for announcing and inviting people to events to be used by groups at UTD (ex. clubs, fraternities, etc.). The project, known as KickMap, is a service that will allow organizations to post kickbacks, kickoffs, socials, and parties in a more easily accessible way. Users can see event announcements, compare them, see tickets availability, and view where they are on a map and when on a calendar. Right now, many of these events are announced in an unorganized fashion of Instagram and Discord Announcements. This application is one way to allow students to know what events are where and when in a more organized format.
